# CSE3050-Project-BuiHuyKien
# Assignment by Dr. Bui Huy Kien

## Team Formation and Task Assignment
- Students form teams of 4-5 members with clearly defined tasks. The evaluation will be based on the assigned tasks.

## Selecting Suitable Projects for Applying Machine Learning Algorithms
- Explore various projects suitable for applying the following four machine learning algorithms:
  1. Linear Regression
  2. K-means Clustering
  3. Logistic Regression
  4. Support Vector Machines (SVM)

For example, such as predicting house prices with Linear Regression, customer clustering with K-means, spam email detection with Logistic Regression, and Irish flower classification using Support Vector Machines (SVM).

## Problem-Solving Approach
- Implement the chosen problems in two ways:
  + Using mathematical analysis, defining relevant functions.
  + Implement using the Scikit-learn library.

## Comparing Results
- Compare and analyze the results achieved from both implementation methods.

## Report Guidelines
- Present a report focused on analysis, methods, algorithms, and results.
- Do not include source code in the report.
- Store the source code for each task on GitHub and provide reference links in the report.

### Team Collaboration
- Each team member should have a clearly defined role in the project.
- Tasks should be divided based on the expertise and interests of each member.

### Application of Machine Learning Algorithms
- Implement the four machine learning algorithms: Linear Regression, K-means Clustering, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) on the selected projects.
- Document the mathematical analysis and definitions of relevant functions for each algorithm.
- Implement similar algorithms using the Scikit-learn library and compare the results.

### Project Presentation
- Clearly present the selected projects and reasons for choosing them.
- Discuss the method of implementing machine learning algorithms, including mathematical analysis and implementation using Scikit-learn.

### Result Analysis
- Analyze and explain the results obtained from both implementation methods.
- Discuss any observed differences, advantages, or limitations between the two methods.

### GitHub Project Repository
- Maintain a separate GitHub repository for each implemented project.
- Include source code, datasets, and any necessary documentation in the repositories.

### Reference Links
- Provide reference links to the GitHub repositories for each task in the report.

### Submission Guidelines
- Submit a comprehensive report summarizing the work and results of the team.
- Ensure clarity in presentation and adherence to the guidelines.
